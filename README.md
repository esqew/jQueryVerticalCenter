jQueryVerticalCenter (deprecated)
====================
**IMPORTANT!** You really should no longer use this plugin to vertically align your HTML elements. The HTML spec now includes [`flexbox`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) which is better able to vertically center your content in pretty much every single way.

A project to dynamically center HTML elements vertically using the jQuery library.

Usage
--------------------
    $("p").vAlign();
